> A system that transfers the medical feild to another level
>
> Medtech aims to transform hospital management systems by implementing AI-driven solutions, including a robot-assisted ER diagnosis system and AI-based scheduling tools created to enhance hospitals' efficiency.

### User Stories

- As a receptionist in a hospital, I would like to add patients coming into the system database, so the AI Doctor knows where he is needed to diagnose patients

- As a doctor, I want to log in to my account so I can see my schedule and tasks
- As a doctor working in the ER, I want an AI-powered robot that assists me in diagnosing and starting the treatment process by sending me a report immediately to approve so the patients donâ€™t wait when the ER gets crowded.

- As an admin, I want a scheduling system to request and schedule meetings efficiently taking into consideration the staff availability and hospital needs. So the meeting can be scheduled at the perfect time.
- As an admin, I want to receive up-to-date statistics about the hospital, allowing me to make informed decisions and track the hospital's performance.

> I designed MedTech using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Mockups

### MedTech is built using the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I used it to create the frontend of my application, providing a responsive and interactive user experience
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a powerful PHP framework for developing web applications. It was used to build the backend of my project, handling tasks like user authentication, database interactions, and API endpoints.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is a widely-used open-source relational database management system. In my project, it stored and managed hospital data, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. I leveraged TensorFlow for image detection, allowing my application to analyze and interpret images, potentially for medical diagnostics or other purposes.
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is a hardware and software platform for building electronic projects. I used Arduino to create a robot that scans images of patients. This integration of hardware and software enabled automated image capture and potentially improved the efficiency of patient data acquisition.
- Utilized [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time push notifications, enhancing user engagement and timely updates in the healthcare application.

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title6.svg"/>

> To set up MedTech locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE: You'll need the Arduino IDE to upload code to the Arduino board and ESP8266 microchip.

- Arduino Uno: The main control board for the car and paths.

- ESP8266 (Hardware): Used for wireless communication between the system and the arduino.

- OV7670 (Hardware): A camera module for capturing pictures of the patients.

### Installation

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- Install back-end packages
  ```sh
  composer install.
  ```
- Insert your Open AI key in .env file
- Copy this into Arduino IDE prefrences -> Additional boards manager URLs
  ```sh
  https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer/blob/f71e3d427b5be9791a8a2c93cf8079792c3a9a26/library.json,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
  ```
- From the Boards manager you should be able to download esp32 board to upload the code to it

- Upload Arduino files to boards

Now, you should be able to run MedTech locally and explore its features.
